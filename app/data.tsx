          What is skin aging? Skin slackening and wrinkles are consequences of
          the natural aging process of the skin. Skin slackening occurs because
          deeper connective tissue bands stretch. These normally keep the skin
          structure and fat compartments together. Because you produce less fat
          tissue, collagen, and elastin as you get older and because the
          underlying bone structure shrinks, those bands relax, and so does the
          skin. This can also cause wrinkles. Wrinkles in facial skin are caused
          by both hereditary internal and external environmental factors.
          Anti-Aging treatments at SkinHouse. Wrinkles and sagging skin often
          give you an older and tired appearance. Many people are bothered by
          them because they look different than they feel. For example, a frown
          line can make someone look angry, even though they are not. At
          SkinHouse, we can target skin slackening and wrinkles effectively.
          What is the result of the treatment? The result of the Anti-Aging
          treatment depends on the treatment we apply. That is why we always
          start with a thorough analysis of your skin, after which we create a
          tailor-made treatment plan and home care plan. Whatever treatment we
          use, our goal is always to bring out your natural beauty and make your
          skin smoother, firmer, and more even for a fresh and youthful
          appearanceâ€¦ Our Anti-Aging treatments:

          What is Hyperpigmentation? Hyperpigmentation is caused by melanin -
          the pigment that gives your skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin
          is produced by cells called melanocytes. When these cells become
          damaged or unhealthy, it can lead to an overproduction of melanin in
          certain areas, resulting in patches of skin that appear darker than
          the surrounding skin. There are several factors that can contribute to
          hyperpigmentation, including:

            What is Couperose?
          </strong>{" "}
          Couperose is the presence of small red and/or blue blood vessels on
          the face. It is a harmless phenomenon that mainly occurs in people
          with fair skin. Usually, the first blood vessels become visible from
          the age of 30. The condition is more common in women than in men.
          Couperose occurs when superficial blood vessels in the skin relax and
          therefore widen. A clear cause of couperose is not always
          identifiable, but several factors and triggers can influence it. These
          include heredity, excessive sun exposure, skin type (people with
          lighter skin types seem to have a higher chance of developing
          couperose), frequent use of hormone ointments and creams containing
          corticosteroids, a damaged skin barrier, temperature fluctuations, and
          alcohol consumption.

            What is Rosacea?
          </strong>{" "}
          Rosacea is a common chronic skin condition on the face. It can be
          recognized by bright red discolorations, especially on the cheeks and
          nose. Rosacea usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 and more
          often in women than in men. The exact cause of rosacea is not known.
          However, we know that there are factors that can exacerbate the
          condition. The most important of these are alcohol or strongly spiced
          or hot food, vasodilator drugs, temperature and climate (rosacea is
          usually worst in winter), sensitivity to creams, cleansing lotions,
          and the like, and hormones.

          After a treatment for couperose or rosacea, you will notice that the

          Often, multiple treatments are needed for optimal results. How many
          treatments you need depends, among other things, on the severity of
          the condition, but other factors also play a role. During the first
          consultation, we create a tailor-made treatment plan so you know what

            What is Acne?
          </strong>{" "}
          Acne is a common skin condition that can look very different from
          person to person. While some only have a few blemishes, others
          struggle with severe inflammation. A common misconception is that only
          young people deal with acne. You can also have it at a later age.
          Sebaceous glands can become clogged due to excessive sebum production
          combined with a buildup of dead skin cells, or a hormonal imbalance
          can occur, causing increased sebum production. The P. acnes bacterium
          (Propionibacterium acnes) can also cause acne. This bacterium damages
          the wall of the canal where sebum is excreted, causing the sebum to
          enter the surrounding skin. This often leads to subcutaneous
          inflammation, redness, and pimples.

          Immediately after the treatment, you may notice that your skin is
          slightly red and swollen. This is normal and will disappear on its
          own. Shortly after the treatment, it may be that inflammations and
          impurities briefly increase. This is due to the &apos;purging
          phase.&apos; By &apos;bringing up&apos; waste products, your skin may
          develop more impurities for a while. Once this phase is over, your
          skin will gradually clear up.

            What is sensitive skin?
          </strong>{" "}
          Dry or dehydrated skin is very annoying. A skin that is lacking in
          moisture and therefore feels dry is more sensitive to other skin
          problems such as wounds and acne. You may also experience itching,
          flakes, and eczema. A dehydrated skin can look dull and lifeless. Dry
          skin is common and can have various causes. For example, skin that
          frequently comes into contact with water and soap can dry out a lot.
          Water and soap cause the natural lipid layer of the skin to disappear.
          Also, the winter season increases the risk of dehydrated skin. Think
          of a dry atmosphere in rooms with central heating and the cold dry air
          in the winter months outside. Age also plays a role. Especially on the
          lower legs and forearms, the older skin loses the ability to retain
          moisture. This is because the barrier function of the epidermis
          deteriorates. The connective tissue in the dermis becomes stiffer and
          less elastic.

          </strong>{" "}
          After a treatment, your skin will feel less dry. Because the skin is
          hydrated again, you will notice that it regains its natural glow. The
          restored moisture balance also ensures that your skin is better
          protected against harmful external influences.

            Pregnancy facial treatment at SkinHouse.
          </strong>{" "}
          During pregnancy, hormonal fluctuations cause healthy skin to change
          to dry, oily, and even acne or a pregnancy mask. We will maintain and
          even improve skin condition during pregnancy! A facial treatment is
          always nice, but when you are pregnant, you can pamper yourself extra
          by relaxing and giving your skin extra attention during a facial
          treatment. Depending on the condition of the skin at that time, we
          choose the appropriate products. When you are pregnant, you may
          experience restless and impure skin. Then we will use products that
          deeply cleanse the skin and have anti-inflammatory effects. There are
          also women who get a very dull complexion during their pregnancy.
          Then, of course, we choose different products that are focused on
          anti-aging, moisture regulation, or against pigmentation spots.
          We&apos;ll pamper you extra - our Garieni Soft Cushion wellness bed
          allows you to rest your back and legs during the treatmentâ€¦.{" "}

          During pregnancy, hormones are extra active, which can lead to faster
          hyperpigmentation, such as a pregnancy mask (melasma). It is therefore
          necessary to protect the skin well with a sunscreen SPF50.

            Men&apos;s Care treatments at SkinHouse.
          </strong>{" "}
          Facial treatments for men often have a number of fixed components,
          including cleansing, exfoliating, a mask, and a moisturizing cream.
          Skin care starts with cleansing and a scrub/peel to remove dead skin
          cells. Also, impurities such as pimples and blackheads are removed.
          This can sometimes be a bit sensitive, but the result is worth it.
          Once the skin is clean, we will ensure deep hydration.... but first a
          relaxing massage ðŸ™‚ Because men&apos;s skin is often drier than that
          of women, an intensely nourishing cream is used that is not greasy.
          You leave the salon with clean and fresh skin that feels soft and
          healthy again.

            A facial treatment for men can be completely tailored to your wishes
            and needs. Do you have special wishes? Be sure to mention them
            beforehand.

          <li>
            Do not shave your skin just before a facial treatment. Your skin can
            be damaged and therefore extra sensitive to some products. It is
            therefore better to shave the evening or day before.

        <p>
          The HydraFacial Keravive treatment is relaxing and completely
          painless. A slight warming sensation or mild itching of the scalp may
          be felt the same day.

            What is the result of the treatment?
          </strong>{" "}
          HydraFacial Keravive optimizes the scalp&apos;s natural ability to
          produce keratin, stimulates blood vessels, and improves
          microcirculation. The result? Healthier, thicker, and more voluminous
          hair! Improvement is visible one month after the first session, and
          hair improves during the treatment to become optimal two months after
          the third session. HydraFacial Keravive is also an ideal preparation
          for a PRP treatment and can be included in an overall plan for hair
          stimulation and growth.
